> An end-to-end, serverless pipeline on AWS for real-time validation of European VAT invoices. Fully deployed and managed with Infrastructure as Code.

---

## üìå Project Overview

**VCM (VAT Compliance Monitor)** is a production-grade, event-driven pipeline that automates the validation of European VAT invoices. The entire system is defined and deployed using **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** with the AWS SAM Framework.

This project solves a critical business problem by transforming unstructured, real-world PDF invoices‚Äî**including low-quality scans**‚Äîinto validated, auditable, and analytics-ready records, all automatically.

---

## üåê Interactive Preview

## üó∫Ô∏è System Architecture

This diagram shows how invoices flow through the system from upload to validation and analytics.

### Medallion layers
The project follows the Medallion Architecture approach, structuring data into three distinct layers:

* **Bronze:** for storing raw, ingested data.
* **Silver:** for cleaned, processed, and transformed data.
* **Gold:** for business-ready datasets.

This layered design improves data quality, reliability, and usability. **[Full methodology here](https://github.com/kevindellapiazza/data-foundations-for-ai)**

## üöÄ How It Works (Step-by-Step)

1.  **Ingestion & Preprocessing:** A user uploads a PDF to the `raw/` prefix in the main **Invoice Bucket** (`vcm-kevin-pipeline-invoices`). This S3 event triggers a Docker-based **`preprocess-lambda`** that uses `ocrmypdf` to clean the file and apply a text layer, saving the result to the `processed/` prefix within the same bucket.

2.  **Extraction, Validation & Storage:** The new file in the `processed/` prefix triggers the **`textract-lambda`**. This function is the core of the pipeline and performs several actions:
    * It uses **Amazon Textract** for intelligent OCR.
    * It validates the extracted data against business rules.
    * It saves the `PASS`/`FAIL` result to **Amazon DynamoDB** for real-time status checks.
    * It saves the full, structured result to the separate **Analytics Bucket** (`vcm-config-kevin`) as a Parquet file.
    * It sends an operational update for every invoice to **Slack**.

3.  **Critical Alerting:** A `FAIL` status written to DynamoDB triggers the **`alert-lambda`** via a DynamoDB Stream. This function sends a detailed failure notification via **Amazon SES (email)**.

4.  **Serverless Analytics:** An **AWS Glue Crawler** catalogs the Parquet files from the Analytics Bucket, making them instantly queryable using standard SQL in **Amazon Athena**.

---

## ‚ú® Key Features & Architectural Highlights

1.  **100% Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** The entire cloud infrastructure‚ÄîS3 buckets, DynamoDB tables, all three Lambda functions, IAM roles, and event triggers‚Äîis defined in a single `template.yaml` file. The whole system can be reliably deployed in any AWS account with a single `sam deploy` command.

2.  **Automated Preprocessing for "Dirty" PDFs:** The system solves the common problem of unreadable documents. A Docker-based Lambda function uses `ocrmypdf` to clean and apply a text layer to any incoming PDF, ensuring even scanned documents are machine-readable.

3.  **AI-Powered Data Extraction:** **AWS Textract** intelligently extracts structured data (VAT IDs, amounts, dates) from the cleaned PDFs, overcoming variations in invoice layouts.

4.  **Data Lake & Analytics Layer:** Processed data is saved in the optimized **Parquet** format. An **AWS Glue Crawler**, also defined as code, automatically catalogs this data, making it instantly queryable via standard SQL with **Amazon Athena**.

## üéØ Why This Matters

-   üí∏ Businesses lose dozens of hours per month manually validating invoices for tax compliance.
-   ‚ùå Small VAT mismatches can lead to major penalties, audit failures, or rejected tax filings.
-   üìâ Most companies still rely on spreadsheets and shared drives for compliance workflows.

VCM automates this process end-to-end‚Äîintelligently, scalably, and cost-effectively. As a data and cloud engineer, I built VCM to reflect the kind of automation modern finance teams need.

---

## ‚ö° The Result

A system that is:

- ‚úÖ **Smart Compliance** ‚Äî flags errors in incorrectly filled invoices and confirms valid ones
- ‚úÖ **Scalable** ‚Äî can handle hundreds of invoices per day  
- ‚úÖ **Cost-effective** ‚Äî runs on AWS with near-zero infrastructure cost  
- ‚úÖ **Fully automated** ‚Äî no human intervention required  

---

## üí∞ Cloud Cost Estimate (10,000 Invoices / Month)

This system is optimized for affordability, even at an enterprise scale.  
All costs are based on **eu-central-1 (Frankfurt)** region, using AWS's public pricing (as of June 2025).

### üßÆ Monthly Cost ‚Äî 10,000 Invoices (Enterprise Usage)

| Service           | Approx. Cost | Description |
|------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Textract OCR** | $15.00       | 1 page/invoice √ó 10,000 √ó $0.0015 |
| **Lambda compute** | $0.02      | 400 ms @ 256 MB ‚Üí ~1,000 GB-s |
| **Lambda requests** | $0.002     | 10,000 √ó $0.20 per 1M requests |
| **Amazon SES**   | $1.00        | 10,000 emails @ $0.10 per 1K |
| **S3 Storage**   | ~$0.20       | PDFs + Parquet (~1 GB/month) |
| **Glue + Athena**| ~$1.00       | 1 crawler run + ~50 queries |
| **TOTAL**        | **~$18.25/month** | Fully serverless, 10k invoices processed monthly |

> üîç **Textract accounts for ~90% of total cost**. All other components combined cost < $5/month.

## üîê Security Best Practices (Deployed in eu-central-1)

| Layer     | Practice |
|-----------|----------|
| **S3**    | Server-side encryption (SSE-S3) enabled by default |
| **IAM**   | Each Lambda has least-privilege IAM roles (S3 + logging only) |
| **SES**   | Sandbox mode; verified sender & recipients only |
| **Parquet Output** | Stored in private S3 path, queryable only via Athena |
| **Monitoring** | CloudWatch logs + EventBridge alerts on failures |
| **No Public Access** | All resources use private IAM-authenticated triggers |

> ‚úÖ Compliant with AWS‚Äôs Well-Architected security pillar ‚Äî safe for real-world invoice data.

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

-   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Designed and deployed a complete, multi-resource cloud application from a single, reusable AWS SAM template.
-   **Serverless & Event-Driven Architecture:** Built a robust, scalable, and cost-efficient pipeline using S3 event triggers, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB Streams.
-   **AI/ML Integration:** Leveraged AWS Textract for intelligent document processing (OCR) to extract structured data from unstructured PDFs.
-   **Data Engineering:** Created a data pipeline that transforms and stores data in an analytics-optimized format (Parquet) and built a data catalog with AWS Glue for querying in Amazon Athena.
-   **CI/CD & DevOps:** Implemented a Continuous Integration workflow with GitHub Actions to automate code quality checks and testing.
-   **Cloud Security:** Applied the principle of least privilege with specific IAM roles for each service and managed secrets securely outside of version control using parameters.

---

## ‚úÖ Continuous Integration (CI)

This project uses **GitHub Actions** to automatically run quality checks on every commit:
-   Check code quality with **Ruff**.
-   Run tests with **Pytest**.

---

## üí° Future Improvements

-   **Implement Full CI/CD:** The current GitHub Action performs CI (testing). The next step is to add a CD (Continuous Deployment) stage that automatically runs `sam deploy` on every successful merge to the `main` branch.
-   **Replace Regex with Amazon Comprehend:** To make data extraction even more robust and language-agnostic, the Regex-based logic could be replaced with a custom Named Entity Recognition (NER) model trained using Amazon Comprehend.

---

## üì¶ Configuration

Validation logic is driven by the file:  
`data/allowed-vat-rates.csv`

This file maps each country code to its allowed VAT rates and enables country-specific rule checks.  
Making this external (not hardcoded) ensures scalability and maintainability.
